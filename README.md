# Covert Channel Detection CLI Tool

## Overview
This Python project aims to build a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to capture network packets, perform various statistical analyses on them, and detect potential covert channels.

### Key Features
- **Packet Capture**: Capture various types of network packets (e.g., IP, TCP, UDP).
- **Statistics Generation**: Generate statistics on packet data, such as packet sizes, timings, and protocols.
- **Covert Channel Detection**: Analyze network traffic to identify possible covert channels using statistical anomalies.
- **CLI Interface**: User-friendly CLI for interacting with the tool, managing captures, and displaying results.
