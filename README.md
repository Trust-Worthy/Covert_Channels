# Covert Channel Detection CLI Tool

## Overview
This Python project aims to build a command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to capture network packets, perform various statistical analyses on them, and detect potential covert channels.

### Key Features
- **Packet Capture**: Capture various types of network packets (e.g., IP, TCP, UDP).
- **Statistics Generation**: Generate statistics on packet data, such as packet sizes, timings, and protocols.
- **Covert Channel Detection**: Analyze network traffic to identify possible covert channels using statistical anomalies.
- **CLI Interface**: User-friendly CLI for interacting with the tool, managing captures, and displaying results.

### Folder Structure


## 2. Core Components

### Packet Capture Module
- **Description**: This module is responsible for capturing network packets in real-time.
- **Main Libraries**: `scapy`, `pyshark`
- **Functions**:
  - `start_capture()`: Initiates packet capture based on user configuration (e.g., interfaces, filters).
  - `stop_capture()`: Stops the packet capture and returns the captured data.
  - `save_capture()`: Saves the captured packets to a file (e.g., `.pcap` format).
  - `load_capture()`: Loads previously saved packet captures for analysis.

### Statistics Module
- **Description**: This module generates various statistics on the captured packets.
- **Functions**:
  - `generate_packet_statistics()`: Generates basic statistics like packet sizes, protocol distributions, and timing data.
  - `calculate_packet_interval()`: Calculates time intervals between packets.
  - `protocol_distribution()`: Analyzes the distribution of protocols in the capture (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
  - `traffic_volume()`: Computes the volume of data over time.

### Covert Channel Detection Module
- **Description**: This module analyzes the captured packets and statistics to detect potential covert channels.
- **Covert Channel Techniques**: Time-based, size-based, frequency-based, etc.
- **Functions**:
  - `detect_timing_anomalies()`: Detects hidden information based on timing patterns.
  - `detect_size_anomalies()`: Analyzes packet sizes to find unusual patterns indicative of covert communication.
  - `entropy_analysis()`: Measures the entropy of packet sizes or timings to detect non-random patterns.
  - `correlation_analysis()`: Checks for correlations between different packet attributes (e.g., size vs. time).
  
## 3. CLI Interface
- **Description**: The command-line interface (CLI) allows users to interact with the tool, start and stop packet captures, view statistics, and run covert channel detection.
- **Main Commands**:
  - `start-capture`: Start capturing packets.
  - `stop-capture`: Stop capturing packets and save the capture data.
  - `view-stats`: Display statistics about the captured packets.
  - `detect-covert-channels`: Run covert channel detection algorithms on the captured data.
- **Command Options**:
  - `--interface`: Specify the network interface to capture from.
  - `--filter`: Apply packet filters (e.g., by protocol or IP).
  - `--output`: Save output to a file.

#### Example CLI Usage:
```bash
$ python cli.py start-capture --interface eth0 --filter "tcp" --output capture.pcap
$ python cli.py view-stats --input capture.pcap
$ python cli.py detect-covert-channels --input capture.pcap
