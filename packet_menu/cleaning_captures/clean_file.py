This file will be used to clean all of the junk from the txt files.

I want this to return a nice byte array of all the bytes in the corresponding packet. 
These bytes will then be processed and converted into an array of protocols!

Should I create a "Capture" class that holds an array of all the captures in a particular file?
Maybe include a pandas dataframe of everything?
