## be wary of overfitting to 'one part' of the conversation: ex TLS application data
## MLP --> multi layer perceptron
### Create multiple neural networks to handle TCP, UDP ECT. use an initial NN to classify in TCP, UDP, ICMP
#### Idea for the CNN shape. Instead of using a square... use a circle? Just like in soccer how you get a line
## Creating ML features --> how much of the packet do I want to be my features. ex. 64 btyes for the entire size of the packet!
# I get it. Packet statistics so that I can see the size of my dataset before curating my features (deciding what I want to anaylize with my NN)
# I'm on the correct path 
# training dataset 90K
# validation dataset ---> add ground truths (aka labels) (should be 1/10 of training) --> 9k
# test dataset --> data that the model has never seen. Just make sure that the
